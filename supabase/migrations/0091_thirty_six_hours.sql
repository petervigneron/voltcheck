-- 72 hours was still too long. Owner, 2026-09-12, on being told a car
-- leaves the site three days after it was last seen: "Three days is not good
-- enough." The standard he set is "comprehensive listings that are real,
-- active, and timely."
--
-- Measured at the moment of writing (173,175 live rows):
--   seen or confirmed within 12 h  157,761
--                        24 h      161,755
--                        36 h      162,672
--                        48 h      163,685
--                        72 h      165,167
--
-- Every source that vouches for a car runs at least once a day (the rolling
-- crawl every ~30 min over most rooftops, the recheck and the sweeps
-- nightly), so 36 hours is the tightest window that one slipped nightly —
-- it fires 3–7 h after its 10:30 UTC cron and has failed on ordinary nights
-- (09-05, 09-06, 09-09, 09-10) — cannot empty a whole lane by itself. 24
-- hours is the target, and it becomes safe the moment the recheck runs
-- twice a day; that is the next change, not this one. The marketplace
-- lanes' own-page window (rule 2) comes down from 48 h to 36 h for the same
-- reason.
--
-- Cost tonight against 0090: 2,495 more rows withheld (165,167 → 162,672),
-- almost all of them on rooftops the browser crawl alone can read, which
-- has been switched off since 09-04 and is being brought back; the browser
-- pass running as this is written (recheck-browser.yml, every withheld
-- car) re-admits the live ones at the next publish.
